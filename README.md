### Introduction:
The project created in collaboration with Exlibris as part of the final project in the Department of Software Engineering
At the Jerusalem College of Engineering - Azrieli.

The purpose of the project is to create a reliable system that will allow readers to receive recommendations for books similar to the book they were looking for by predicting word similarity with the help of language processing.

In general, today there are many recommendation systems that are based on different data and include artificial intelligence processes on the information and thus contract recommendations according to the requirements of those systems.

Exlibris currently has a product called Primo that is used by students to find books. Primo currently has a book recommendation mechanism based on identical words search and not by language processing

The aim of the project is to create a book recommendation mechanism according to the book topics using NLP
